## [4.0.0-dev] - 2026-07-30

### Breaking Changes
- **Printing is now asynchronous (print queue).** The print endpoints (`/text/print`, `/image/print`, `/qrcode/print`, `/label/text-qrcode`, `/label/text-image`, `/pdf/print`) now enqueue the job and return **immediately**. The response shape is unchanged (`{ "success": true, "job_id": "...", "message": "..." }`), but its meaning changed:
  - `success: true` now means **"queued"**, not "printed".
  - A print **failure** no longer comes back as an HTTP error on the print call — the call still returns `200`, and the failure surfaces later as the job's status (`failed`).
  - The `message` text changed (e.g. `"Print job queued"` instead of `"Text printed successfully"`).
  - *Migration:* to confirm the actual print result, poll `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` and check `status` (`done` / `failed`). Fire-and-forget clients that do not inspect the result need no change.
- **Large batches require explicit confirmation.** Any print request for **10 or more copies** must include `confirm_large_batch` (`true` for JSON endpoints, `"true"` for multipart). Without it the request is rejected with **HTTP 400** and code `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`.
  - *Migration:* add `confirm_large_batch: true` to requests that print 10+ copies. Requests for fewer than 10 copies are unaffected.

### Added
- **USB / non-network printer support**: `usb://` and `file:///dev/usb/lpX` backends in addition to network printers; keep-alive is automatically disabled where it is not meaningful.
- **Printer status & clock**: IPP-based printer status and reachability reporting, plus a printer clock readout.
- **Health & deployment**: `GET /health` (liveness) and `GET /health/printer` (readiness) endpoints; the app now runs under gunicorn; optional API-key authentication via the `API_KEY` env var; configurable CORS via `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- **Copies, cut & density options**: copies (1–100), cut modes (`each`/`end`/`none`) and density/quality options (600 dpi, HQ). Copies and cut are available directly in every compose section.
- **PDF printing**: upload a PDF, select pages, fit/fill scaling, with per-page preview (`POST /pdf/print`, `POST /pdf/preview`) and a PDF compose tab.
- **Share hand-off**: `POST /api/v1/share` (+ `GET /share/{token}`) to send a PDF or image from a phone (Apple Shortcuts / Android HTTP Shortcuts) straight into the print form.
- **True-to-print live preview**: server-rendered previews for text, QR, combined and image labels (`/text/preview`, `/qrcode/preview`, `/label/preview`, `/image/preview`), backing the instant client-side preview.
- **Optional `settings` on print/preview**: any field of `settings` (or the whole object) may be omitted — the app fills it from its saved configuration, so "print on the configured printer" needs no settings. Fields present in the request still override.
- **Raw PNG previews**: send `Accept: image/png` to the preview endpoints to get the raw PNG bytes (with `X-Label-Width-Px` / `X-Label-Height-Px` headers) instead of the JSON data-URL wrapper.
- **Automatic text wrapping**: long text now wraps at word boundaries to fit the label (with hard-breaking of over-long words) instead of being truncated — in plain text, text+QR side-by-side and QR captions, in both print and preview. On by default; disable per request with `text.wrap: false` (or `settings.text_wrap: false`).
- **Dry run**: pass `dry_run: true` to any print endpoint to validate the request end-to-end (render + printer reachability) without printing or queueing. Returns `{ ok, dry_run, printer_reachable, would_print: { label_size, copies, width_px, height_px } }` — useful for endless media and CI.
- **Print queue**: all jobs are queued and printed sequentially by a single background worker. `/jobs` endpoints to list, get, cancel, reprint, delete and download a job's file, plus a Queue panel. Reprint with the same settings or re-open a job's parameters; image/PDF job files persist for `JOB_FILE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 24 h).
- **Queue controls**: pause/resume (`POST /jobs/pause`, `/jobs/resume`), an emergency stop that cancels all waiting jobs (`POST /jobs/stop`), delete a single job (`POST /jobs/{id}/delete`), clear every job (`POST /jobs/clear-all`), and a queue status endpoint (`GET /jobs/queue`).
- **Text + Image labels**: `POST /label/text-image` endpoint and compose tab to print an uploaded image and a text block side by side.
- **Large-batch confirmation guard**: any print request for 10 or more copies must include an explicit `confirm_large_batch` flag, otherwise it is rejected with HTTP 400 and the machine-readable code `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`. The UI confirms before submitting such a batch.
- **Dynamic keep-alive**: keep-alive can run `forever` or in a `timed` mode that keeps the printer awake only for a configurable window after each print (`keep_alive_mode`, `keep_alive_duration_seconds`), plus an always-visible keep-alive toggle in the top bar.
- **Configurable uploads**: ephemeral, configurable upload folder (`UPLOAD_FOLDER`) with TTL cleanup of staged job/share files (`JOB_FILE_TTL_SECONDS`, `SHARE_TTL_SECONDS`).
- **Demo mode**: a bundled demo layer (`src/static/js/demo.js`) lets the static UI run on GitHub Pages with mocked API data and no backend, plus a `pages.yml` deploy workflow.
- **Font selection**: text is no longer locked to DejaVu Sans Bold. `font_family` and `font_style` (`regular`/`bold`/`italic`/`bold_italic`) can be set per request or saved as the default, on plain text labels and on the text block of the QR and image composites (`text.font_family` / `text.font_style`). `GET /api/v1/fonts` lists the installed families with the styles each one has, and `GET /api/v1/fonts/{family}:{style}/file` serves a face so the live preview renders in the typeface the printer will use. The image now bundles Liberation (metric-compatible with Arial/Times New Roman/Courier New) alongside DejaVu, and any `.ttf`/`.otf` copied into `/app/data/fonts` (`FONTS_DIR`) is picked up within seconds without a restart or a rebuild. Unchanged for existing installs: no family named still renders as DejaVu Sans Bold.
- **Testing & tooling**: unit tests (URI validation, IPP client, settings, printer status, font selection) and project tooling (Dependabot, dependency audit, lint/test configuration).

### Changed
- Reworked the web UI into a "Console" layout: sidebar navigation, light/dark themes that follow the system preference, a fully responsive and iOS-friendly experience, and Settings as its own dedicated view.
- Invalid input now returns HTTP 400 (instead of 500), and image uploads are hardened.
- Expanded documentation for settings, environment variables and API endpoints.
- **Python 3.11 is now the minimum** (was 3.9, which reached end of life in October 2025). The Docker image moves to `python:3.11-slim`. Running from source on 3.9 or 3.10 is no longer supported. This also unblocks current Pillow, urllib3 and requests releases.
- Dependencies: Pillow 10.4.0 → 12.3.0, flask-cors 4.0.0 → 6.0.5, gunicorn 21.2.0 → 23.0.0. `marshmallow`, `pydantic` and `python-dotenv` were unused and have been dropped; `pytest`/`pytest-cov` moved to `requirements-dev.txt` so test tooling stays out of the runtime image.

### Security
- Optional API-key authentication; printer-URI scheme allowlist with an SSRF guard; path-traversal protection on served job/share files; image decompression-bomb limit.

### Fixed
- **Labels are rendered at the loaded roll's real printable width** instead of a hardcoded 696 px (62 mm). Narrower media was previously drawn too wide and rescaled on the way to the printer, so the requested font size never matched what came out — on 50 mm tape everything printed about 20% small and soft. Affects text, images, PDF pages and the combined text+QR and text+image layouts (reported and diagnosed by [MSanteler](https://github.com/MSanteler) in [#18](https://github.com/dodoooh/brother_ql_app/pull/18)).
- **Text on die-cut labels works at all.** The canvas is now pinned to the label's fixed physical height, which `brother_ql` requires; before, any other height was rejected outright.
- **Rotation now has an effect.** The image was rotated once by the app and a second time by `brother_ql`, which returned it to its original orientation — the log said "Rotation applied" and the label came out unrotated. Image and PDF prints also rotate before being fitted to the label, instead of after, which used to leave them narrower than the tape and scaled back up.
- Descenders on the last line are no longer clipped: line height is measured from the font's ascent+descent rather than the ink bounding box, which only covers the glyphs actually present.
- Text on narrow continuous rolls no longer degrades into a column of single letters. With the true width in play, a word can be wider than a 12 mm or P-touch label; the new `auto_fit` setting (on by default) shrinks the font until every word fits a line instead of hard-breaking it. On die-cut labels it shrinks to the fixed height instead. Disable per request with `settings.auto_fit: false`.
- Keep-alive now writes to the printer's raw port (`9100`) instead of only reading status, so it can actually prevent the auto power-off on network printers.
- **Auto-fitting text on continuous tape no longer fails outright.** `scale_mode: "fit"` (and the older `auto_fit: true`) raised `NameError: candidate_lines` on any non-die-cut label, surfacing as a 500 and `Error creating text label` — the shrink-to-fit branch referenced a variable left behind when grow-to-fill was removed. Die-cut labels were unaffected, which is why it went unnoticed.
- Corrected the port example in `docker-compose.yml` (5000).
