    idea whether the rotation or scaling is what the user actually wanted.

    Same shape as the Canva "open in composer" flow: nothing prints, the image
    is persisted as a job, and the editor can open it, adjust rotation and
    scale, and print or discard. See export_canva_design for the reasoning about
    why the queue's global pause cannot be used for this.

    the wrong roll is loaded would defeat the point -- holding it for review is
    exactly when the roll is most likely still to be changed.
