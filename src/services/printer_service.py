        (``_resize_image`` -> optional rotation -> ``_send_to_printer``). As a
        result every page automatically inherits the standard print settings:
        copies, cut_mode, dpi_600, red, rotate, threshold and dither.

        Args:
            pdf_path: Path to the PDF file to print.
            settings: Dict of print settings (same shape as ``print_image``).
            pages: 1-based page-range spec (e.g. ``"1-3,5"``); empty/``None``/
                ``"all"`` prints every page. Validated via ``parse_page_range``.
            scale_mode: ``"fit"`` (default) or ``"fill"``. NOTE: scaling is
                currently delegated entirely to ``_resize_image`` (fit-to-width),
                so ``"fill"`` is accepted and validated but behaves like
                ``"fit"`` for now -- it is a pass-through parameter until a
                die-cut-aware fill path is implemented.

        Returns:
            Dict with ``success``, ``job_id``, ``message`` and ``pages_printed``.

        Raises:
            ValidationError: For invalid ``scale_mode`` / page spec (-> 400).
