"""
In-process print-queue service.

Provides a FIFO print queue backed by a single daemon worker thread. Print
jobs are submitted as argument-less callables; the worker executes them one at
a time so that the printer (which accepts only one connection at a time) is
never driven concurrently.

The design assumes a single process (gunicorn ``--workers 1``): there is exactly
one queue and one worker thread per process. A ``threading.Lock`` guards every
access to the job registry, and all returned job dicts are copies so callers can
never mutate the internal state.
